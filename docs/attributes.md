# Nanowire Network Attributes

Nanowire network (NWN) objects are represented internally as standard [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/tutorial.html)
graphs. All the attributes are listed below. The nanowire network nodes are 
tuples of integers. In the junction-dominated assumption (JDA) NWN graph 
representation, these are one-tuples. In the multi-nodal representation (MNR)
NWN graph representation, they can either be two-tuples in the general case, 
or one-tuples in the case of electrodes or wires with only one junction.
